# ntuple-analysis

PYTHON framework for the analysis of [ROOT](https://root.cern/) `TTree` data using [uproot](https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for the IO and [awkward-array](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/) for the columnar data analysis.

The tool was developed for the analysis of [FastPUPPI](https://github.com/p2l1pfp/FastPUPPI) but should work with any kind of flat ntuple.

## Features

The features

 - To be added

## Requirements

- A computing account on the LXPLUS CERN service.

## Usage

### First time setup

1. Log in to a LXPLUS machine.

    *A computing account at CERN is required.*
    
    *This step is LXPLUS specific, giving access to a more recent Python and Root version. Edit/skip it accordingly for your specific system.*

    ```
    ssh lxplus.cern.ch
    ```
    
    *After that, create a new directory to store the ntuple-analysis project:*

    ```
    mkdir "your directory"
    ```
2. Clone this repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/cerminar/ntuple-analysis.git
    ```
    
    *Or you can create a fork of this repository if you plan to contribute.*

3. CD into your newly created directory:
    ```
    cd "your directory"
    ```

    *Again, perform CD into the ntuple-analysis:*
    ```
    cd ntuple-analysis
    ```

4. Clone [Plot Drawing Tools repository](https://github.com/cerminar/plot-drawing-tools) for the Jupyter Notebook support. 

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/cerminar/plot-drawing-tools.git
    ```

5. Edit the ```setVirtualEnvWrapper.sh``` script to add the HOME directory of your user.

    *You can use Nano, Vim or your other favorite editor.*
    ```
    vim setVirtualEnvWrapper.sh
    ```

    *Edit the first line of the ```setVirtualEnvWrapper.sh``` script:*
    ```
    export WORKON_HOME=/data/YOUR_USERNAME/.virtualenvs
    ```
    *where YOUR_USERNAME is your username.*


6. Run the shell script ```setup_lxplus.sh``` to set-up the LXPLUS service.

    ```
    source setup_lxplus.sh
    ```

7. Run another shell script, ```setVirtualEnvWrapper.sh```, to initialize the virtual environment wrapper. 

     ```
    source setVirtualEnvWrapper.sh
    ```   

    *To learn more about the Virtual Environment Wrapper, you can take a look at the docs [link](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).*
    
8. Create a virtual environment for the project.

    ```
    mkvirtualenv --system-site-packages -p `which python3.9` -r requirements.txt <venvname>
    ```
    *where venvname is the name of your new virtual environment*

    *If you created a virtual environment in a different way, you can use:*
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *NOTE: python > 3.9 is a requirement.**
    
9. Activate the virtual environment (if it's not active already).

    ```
    workon <venvname>
    ```
    *where venvname is the name of your new virtual environment**

10. In order to use Jupyter Notebooks, we need to reinstall the ```traitlets``` package.
    
    ```
    pip uninstall traitlets
    ```

    *and then*
    ```
    pip install traitlets==5.9.0
    ```

11. Install a custom kernel with all of the packages from your virtual environment.

    ```
    python3 -m ipykernel install --name <venvname> --user
    ```
    *where venvname is the name of your new virtual environment**

    *Source: [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28831854/how-do-i-add-python3-kernel-to-jupyter-ipython ))*

12. Launch the Jupyter Notebook.
    
    *You can launch it in the LXPLUS service:*
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    *or, if you are using Windows, to access it from Windows:*
    ```
    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8095
    ```
 
### After the first setup

1. Log in to a LXPLUS machine.

    *A computing account at CERN is required.*

    ```
    ssh lxplus.cern.ch
    ```
    
    *CD into the root directory of the ntuple-analysis*
    ```
    cd "your directory"
    ```
2. Run the shell script ```setup_lxplus.sh``` to set up the LXPLUS service.

    ```
    source setup_lxplus.sh
    ```

3. Run another shell script ```setVirtualEnvWrapper.sh``` to initialize virtual environment wrapper. 

     ```
    source setVirtualEnvWrapper.sh
    ```   

    *To learn more about the Virtual Environment Wrapper, you can take a look at the docs [link](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).*

4. Activate the virtual environment (if it's not active already).

    ```
    workon <venvname>
    ```
    *where venvname is the name of your existing virtual environment from the first set-up.*

    *also, ```lsvirtualenv``` is your friend if you forget the name of the virtualenv.*

### Running the Jupyter Notebook on Windows

You need to do the following:

1. Download [Ubuntu](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pdxgncfsczv?hl=en-us&gl=US) for Windows here and install it.
2. Launch the first instance of Ubuntu (referred to here as #1) and complete all the steps on that machine from [here](#first-time-setup).
3. Launch another instance of Ubuntu (referred to here as #2) and create a tunnel between instance #1 and your Windows machine by:
   ```
   ssh -L 8099:localhost:8095 YOUR_MACHINE_URL
   ```
   *YOUR_MACHINE_URL is the URL of the address to connect to your machine.*

   `NOTE:` If you are going to use the LXPLUS service, it might happen that this tunnel will not be created with the machine that launched Jupyter Notebook with the following:

    ```
    jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8095
    ```

    It means that you need a dedicated CentOS machine.
4. Open http://localhost:8099/ in the browser on Windows.

    `NOTE:` When in Jupyter Notebook, it is important to select a kernel that you have created with the python3 -m ipykernel install command on step 10.
  

## Main script

The main script is ```analyzeNtuples.py```:

```
python analyzeNtuples.py --help
```

An example of how to run it:
```
python analyzeNtuples.py -f cfg/hgctps.yaml -i cfg/datasets/ntp_v81.yaml -c tps -s doubleele_flat1to100_PU200 -n 1000 -d 0
```

### How does analyzeNtuples.py work?

Data are read in `collections` of objects corresponding to an `array` and are 
processed by `plotters`, which create sets of histograms for different `selections` of the data `collections`.

### Configuration files for the analyzeNtuples.py script

The configuration is handled by two YAML files. 

The first YAML (e.g: ```hgctps.yaml```) file specifies:  
   - output directories
   - versioning of the plots
   - collections of samples, i.e., groups of samples to be processed homogeneously:
     - for each collection, the list of plotters (see below) to be run is provided.

The second YAML file (e.g., ```ntp_v81.yaml```) provides:
   - details of the input samples (location of the ntuple files)

An example of the YAML configuration files can be found here:
 - [cfg/egplots.yaml](cfg/egplots.yaml)
 - [cfg/datasets/ntp_v92.yaml](cfg/datasets/ntp_v92.yaml)

## Submitting to the batch system

Note that the script ```analyzeNtuples.py``` can be used to submit the jobs to the HTCondor batch system ,invoking the `-b` option. 
A dag configuration is created, and you can actually submit it following the script output.

### Note about the HADD job.

For each sample injected into the batch system, a DAG is created. The DAG will submit a hadd command once all the jobs succeed. However, if you don't want to wait (or don't care), you can also submit a condor job that will run periodically, thus dramatically reducing the latency. For example:

```condor_submit batch_single_empart_guns_tracks_v77/ele_flat2to100_PU0/batch_harvest.sub```


## FAQ

#### - How can you read ntuple branches or create derived branches?

The list of branches to be read and converted to `Awkward Arrays` format is specified in the module.

[collections](python/collections.py)

Instantiating an object of class `DFCollection`. What is actually read event by event depends anyhow on which plotters are actually instantiated (collections are read on-demand).

#### - How can you select a subset of an object collection?
Selections are defined as strings in the module:

[selections](python/selections.py)

Different collections are defined for different objects and/or different purposes. The selections have a name,whichh is used for the histogram naming (see below). Selections are used by the plotters. Selections can be combined and retrieved via regular expressions in the configuration of the plotters.

### - How can you add a new plotter?

The actual functionality of accessing the objects, filtering them according to the `selections`, and filling histograms is provided by the plotter classes defined in the module:

[plotters](python/plotters.py)

Basic plotters are already available; most likely, you just need to instantiate one of them (or a collection of them) using the DFCollection instance you are interested in. Which collection is run for which sample is steered by the configuration file.

The plotters access one or more collections, select them in several different ways, book them, and fill in the histograms (see below).

### - How can you add a new histogram?
Histograms are handled in the module:

[l1THistos](python/l1THistos.py)

There are different classes of histograms depending on the input object and the purpose. To add a new histogram to an existing class, it is enough to add it in the corresponding constructor and in the `fill` module. The writing of the histos to files is handled transparently.

The histogram naming follows the convention:
`<ObjectName>_<SelectionName>_<GenSelectionName>_<HistoName>`

This is assumed in all the `plotters` and in the code to actually draw the histograms.

#### Histogram drawing

Of course, you can use your favorite set of tools. 
I use my [plot-drawing-tools](https://github.com/cerminar/plot-drawing-tools), 
which is based on `Jupyter notebooks`.


```
cd ntuple-analysis
git clone git@github.com:cerminar/plot-drawing-tools.git
jupyter-notebook
```

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, you are very welcome. Just fork the project, set it up on your own machine, and play with it. If you have any questions, post them on the issues/discussions tab.

Currently, I can't figure out how to do some manipulation using the `awkward array` or `uproot`.You can take a look at examples and play with the arrays in:
